    <h3>üöÄ My Web Dev Journey So Far</h3>
    <p>
      After graduating with a BSc in Computer Science and Information Technology from UKZN in 2024, I decided to dive deeper into web development. While university gave me a strong foundation in programming (mostly with Java), building real websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript opened up a new world for me. This article reflects on how I made the shift from theory to hands-on projects.

    <h3>üí° What I‚Äôve Learned About HTML So Far</h3>
    <p>
      HTML seemed simple at first ‚Äî just tags and structure ‚Äî but I quickly realized how important it is to build a good foundation. From semantic elements to structuring pages for SEO, there‚Äôs more to it than meets the eye. In this post, I talk about the small things that make a big difference when writing HTML.

    <h3> From Java to Web: Bridging the Gap</h3>
    <p>
      At UKZN, we mostly worked in Java ‚Äî learning object-oriented principles, data structures, and frameworks.
      Transitioning into web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) felt like entering a different world. Here, I talk about what stayed the same,
       what changed, and how my degree helped me adapt.

  <h3>üè´ Building a School Management System with My Team</h3>
  <p>
    During my final year at UKZN, I worked with a team to develop a fully functional School Management System as part of a major project. 
    The system was built using the <strong>ASP.NET  framework</strong> with <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> for the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal was to create a platform that allows school staff to manage student records, classes, and reporting efficiently. 
    We faced real-world challenges like database design, user authentication, and system testing ‚Äî all of which helped us grow as developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project was well-received and we scored <strong>70%</strong> for it. 
    It was a big confidence boost and helped me see the value of collaboration, planning, and writing clean backend code.
